\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}

Science is driven by the analysis of data of growing variety and complexity.
Modern advances in sensor
technology, combined with the availability of inexpensive storage, has led to
rapid increases in the amount of data available to scientists in almost
every discipline.  Solar physics is no exception to this trend. For example,
NASA's \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (\textit{SDO}) spacecraft, launched 
in February 2010, produces over 1 TB of data per day \citep{aia}. Managing and
analysing this mountain of data requires increasingly sophisticated software 
tools.
These tools should be robust, easy of use and modify, have a transparent 
development history, as well as conforming to modern software engineering 
standards.
Software with these qualities provide a strong foundation which can support the 
needs of the community as data volumes grow and science questions evolve.

The SunPy project aims to provide a free, open-source and openly developed 
software package for the analysis and visualisation of solar data. SunPy makes 
use of the Python programming language and scientific Python packages. Python 
is a general-purpose, powerful and easy-to-learn high-level programming 
language.

% meaningless.

%removed until better reference is found for this statistic.
Python is widely used outside of scientific fields in areas like web development, 
education and `big data' analytics.

The development of a package such as SunPy is made possible by the 
rich ecosystem of scientific packages available in Python. Core packages such 
as \texttt{NumPy}, \texttt{SciPy} and \texttt{matplotlib} 
provide the basic functionality expected of a scientific programming language:
e.g., array manipulation, core numerical algorithms and visualisation. 
Building upon these foundations, packages such as \texttt{astropy}, \texttt{pandas} and 
\texttt{scikit-image} provide more domain-specific functionality.

SunPy is designed to be a clean, simple-to-use, and well-structured 
package that provides the \textit{core} tools for solar data analysis. 
The primary focus of SunPy's early development are 
specialised data types that enable the acquisition, processing and 
visualisation of all types of solar data.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of SunPy's current 
capabilities, an overview of the project's development model, community aspects of the 
project, and future plans. The latest release of SunPy, version 0.4,
can be downloaded from \url{http://sunpy.org} or can be
installed using the Python package index (\url{http://pypi.python.org/pypi}).
