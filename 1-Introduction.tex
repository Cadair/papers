\section{Introduction}

Science is driven by the analysis of data. Modern advances in sensor
technology combined with the availability of cheap storage has led to
rapid increases in amount of data available to scientists in almost
every discipline.  Solar physics is no exception to this trend. NASA's
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite, launched in February 2010,
produces over 1 TB of catalogued and stored data per day. Managing and
analysing this mountain of data to enable scientific discovery
requires increasingly sophisticated software tools.  Key qualities
that these tools should have include robustness, ease of use, a
transparent development history, ease of modification, and conformance
to standards.  Software with these qualities provides a strong
foundation which is responsive to the needs of the community as data
volumes grow and science questions evolve.

SunPy aims to provide a free, open-source and openly developed software package 
for the analysis and visualisation of solar data. SunPy makes use of the Python 
programming language and the breadth of high-quality science-focused packages 
written in that language. Python is a general-purpose, 
powerful and easy-to-learn high-level programming language.
According to the 
2014 TIOBE Index\footnote{\url{http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html}},
 Python is one of the top ten most popular programming languages in the world 
and is widely used outside of scientific fields in web development, education 
and `big data' analytics.

The development of a package such as SunPy in Python is made possible by the 
rich ecosystem of scientific packages available in Python. Core packages in this 
ecosystem such as \texttt{NumPy}, \texttt{SciPy} and \texttt{matplotlib} 
provide the basic functionality expected of a scientific programming language: 
\textit{e.g.}, array manipulation, core numerical algorithms and visualisation. 
Built upon these foundations, packages such as \texttt{Astropy}, \texttt{pandas} and 
\texttt{scikit-image} provide more domain-specific functionality.

The design philosophy of SunPy is to provide a clean, simple-to-use, and well 
structured package that provides the \textit{core} tools for solar-physics data analysis. The 
primary focus of SunPy's early development is to provide specialised, linked, 
data types that allow the acquisition, processing and visualisation of all types 
of solar data.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of SunPy's current 
capabilities, an overview of the development model and community aspects of the 
SunPy project, as well as future plans. The latest release of SunPy (0.4)
can be downloaded from
the official website (\url{http://sunpy.org}) or can be installed using 
the Python package index (\mbox{\url{http://pypi.python.org/pypi}}).
