\subsection{VSO}\label{ssec:vso}

The Virtual Solar Observatory (\href{http://virtualsolar.org}{VSO}) provides a 
single, standard query interface to solar data from different archives 
around the world \citep{hill2009}.
Data products can be requested for specific instruments or missions and
can also be requested based on physical parameters of the data product such
as the wavelength range.
In addition to the VSO's primary web-based interface, a SOAP (Simple Object 
Access Protocol) service is also available.
SunPy's \texttt{vso} module accesses the VSO via the SOAP service using the
\texttt{suds} package.
This module was developed under the European Space Agency's Summer of Code in 
Space (ESA's SOCIS) of 2011.

Listing~\ref{code:vso_query_simple} shows an example of how to query the VSO
using the \texttt{vso} module.
Queries are constructed using one or more attribute objects. Each
attribute object is a constraint on a parameter of the data set, such as the
time, instrument, or wavelength.
Listing~\ref{code:vso_query_simple} also shows how to download the data using
the constructed query. One can use the metadata associated with the data sets to 
specify how the files will be named locally, such as creating subdirectories 
based on the instrument names.

Listing~\ref{code:vso_query_advanced} shows examples of how to make advanced
queries by combining attribute objects.
Two attribute objects can be combined with a logical \texttt{or} operation
using the \texttt{|} (pipe) operator.
All attribute objects provided to the query as arguments are combined with a 
logical \texttt{and} operation.

%schriste - what about just listing the sources as an array to instead of doing a show
%           to make the point that the | query worked appropriately? That would make this
%            listing much shorter.
%Stuart: I suggest removing the second query from here, it dosen't add much.
