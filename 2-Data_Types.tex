\section{Core Data Types}\label{sec:DataTypes}

SunPy provides data strucutures that are specifically designed for the
three primary varieties of solar physics data: images, time series, and
spectra. These core data types are Python classes:
\texttt{Map} (2D spatial data), \texttt{LightCurve} (1D temporal series)
and \texttt{Spectrum} and \texttt{Spectrogram} (1D and 2D spectra). 

These classes allow access to the data
and associated metadata and provide appropriate convenience functions to
enable analysis and visualisation. For each of these classes, the data is
stored in the \texttt{data} attribute while the metadata is stored 
in the \texttt{meta} attribute. (Curently, \texttt{LightCurve} does 
not support the \texttt{meta} attribute.) 
% schriste - can't we just quickly fix this? should be easy enough.
% dps - Spectrogram does not contain meta either! I would suggest
%(Curently, this is just supported by Map, but the other data types will 
%include such attribute soon.)
%SJM: oh what, drop it all together.
It is possible to instantiate the
data types from various
different sources: e.g., files, URLs, arrays.  
%schriste - i removed time ranges as that just looks up a url.
In order to provide instrument-specific specialisation, the core SunPy classes 
make use of subclassing; e.g., \texttt{Map} has an \texttt{AIAMap} 
sub-type for data from the \textit{SDO}/AIA instrument. 
Data visualisation is provided by two functions: \texttt{peek()}, for quick 
plotting, and \texttt{plot()}, for plotting with more fine-grained control that 
integrates with \texttt{matplotlib}.

This section will give a brief overview of the \textit{current} functionality 
of each of these data types.

\subsection{Visualisation}
\label{subsec:Viz}
As demonstrated in this section, the core SunPy data types 
include visualisation methods that are tailored to each data type. 
These visualisation methods all currently utilise the \texttt{matplotlib} 
package, and are designed in such a way that they integrate well with 
the \texttt{pyplot} functional interface of \texttt{matplotlib}.

This design philosophy makes the behaviour of SunPy's visualisation 
routines intuitive to those who already understand the \texttt{matplotlib}
interface, as well as allowing the use of the standard 
\texttt{matplotlib} commands to manipulate the plot parameters (e.g. title, axes).
