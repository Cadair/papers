\section{Core Data Types}
One of the primary focus' of the SunPy library is to provide data structures 
that are 
specifically designed for the various types of data generally processed for 
solar physics. Currently \texttt{SunPy} provides three datatypes, each separate 
from one another to process 2D spatial data (Map), 1D temporal series 
(LightCurve) and 1 and 2D spectra (Spectrum and Spectra).

This section will give a brief overview of the \textit{current} functionality 
of each of these modules and then describe the development plan for future 
improvements to these submodules.
