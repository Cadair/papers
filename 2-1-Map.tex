\subsection{Map}\label{ssec:map}
The Map data type represents 2D spatial data, such as images of the Sun and 
inner heliosphere. It provides a wrapper around a \texttt{numpy} data array and 
its associated spatial coordinates and other metadata. The \texttt{Map} class 
provides methods for typical operations on 2D data, such as rotation, 
re-sampling, and visualisation functionality.
The \texttt{Map} class also provides a convenient interface for loading data 
from a variety of sources, typically a FITS file as shown in 
Listing~\ref{code:aia_1}.

The architecture of the \texttt{Map} class consists of a template map called
\texttt{GenericMap}, which is a subclass of \texttt{astropy.nddata.NDData}. 
\texttt{NDData} is a generic wrapper around an \texttt{ndarray} with a 
\texttt{.meta} attribute to store metadata.
As \texttt{NDData} is currently still in development, \texttt{GenericMap} does 
not yet make full use of its capabilities, but this inheritance structure 
provides for future integration of \texttt{Astropy}. In order to provide 
instrument- or detector-specific integration, \texttt{GenericMap} is designed 
in such a way that it can be subclassed to implement instrument specific 
functionality. Each of these subclasses of \texttt{GenericMap} can register 
with the \texttt{Map} creation factory by implementing a method that returns 
\texttt{True} if the metadata in the file header matches that instrument or 
detector.  This \texttt{Map} factory will then automatically return an instance 
of the specific \texttt{GenericMap} subclass dependant upon the data provided. 
SunPy 0.4 has \texttt{Map} specialisations for the following instruments: 
\textit{YOHKOH/SXT}, \textit{SOHO/EIT} and \textit{LASCO}, \textit{RHESSI}, 
\textit{STEREO/EUVI} and \textit{COR}, \textit{HINODE/XRT},
\textit{PROBA2/SWAP}, \textit{SDO/AIA} and \textit{HMI}, 
and \textit{IRIS} SJI frames. 

The \texttt{Map} class stores standard metadata retrieved from the header of 
the image file in the \texttt{.meta} attribute and provides convenience 
properties for commonly accessed metadata: \textit{e.g.}, \texttt{.instrument}, 
\texttt{.wavelength} or \texttt{.coordinate\_system}. 
Listing \ref{code:aia_1} demonstrates the quick-plot functionality of 
\texttt{Map}; see Section \ref{subsec:Viz} for more discussion of plotting.

In addition to the data-type classes, the \texttt{map} sub-package provides two 
collection classes, \texttt{CompositeMap} and \texttt{MapCube}, for 
temporally and spatially aligned data respectively.
\texttt{CompositeMap} provides methods for overlaying spatially aligned 
data, with support for visualisation of images and contour lines overlaid 
upon each other.
\texttt{MapCube} 
provides methods for animation of its series of \texttt{Map} objects. 
Listings~\ref{code:compmap_1} and \ref{code:mapcube_1} show how to interact 
with these classes.
In addition, Listing~\ref{code:mapcube_2} shows how the \texttt{MapCube} 
classes interacts with the \texttt{matplotlib.animation} submodule to save a 
video.

%schriste - stuart, i agree if you want to remove the following two listings.

>>> Writer = animation.writers['ffmpeg']
>>> writer = Writer(fps=10, metadata=dict(artist='SunPy'), bitrate=1800)

\end{minted}
% In the above example, is Writer, writer clear? 
% Could we add more metadata to the movie? obs_date, instrument, etc...?
