SunPy Papers
============

This is the attempt to write a SunPy paper for submission, firstly, if we get a
talk at SciPy 2013, and failing that at a later date.

The proceedings of SciPy 2013 are being submitted to Computational Science and
Discovery, which is what this LaTeX template is taken from.

This paper is due January 31st, 2014.
