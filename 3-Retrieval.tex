\section{Solar Data Search and Retrieval}\label{sec:retrieval}

Several well-developed resources currently exist within heliophysics which provide  
remote access and data retrieval for a large number of data sources as well as access to 
event databases. As a community-based project, 
SunPy provides support for these resources via the \texttt{net} subpackage. 
In the following subsections, we describe a number of these resources and 
how to use them in SunPy.
