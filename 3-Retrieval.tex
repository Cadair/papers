\section{Solar Data Search and Retrieval}\label{sec:retrieval}

Several well-developed resources currently exist within heliophysics which provide event databases, 
remote access and data retrieval for a large number of data sources. As a community-based project, 
SunPy provides support for these resources via the \texttt{sunpy.net} package. 
In the following subsections, we describe a number of these resources and 
introduce current methods for accessing them within SunPy.
