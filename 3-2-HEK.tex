\subsection{HEK}\label{ssec:hek}

The Sun is an active star and exhibits a wide range of phenomena on
many different time-scales, length-scales and wavelengths.
Observations and metadata concerning these phenomena are collected at
the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK).  Entries are generated
both by automated algorithms and human observers.  Some of the
information in the HEK reproduces feature/event data elsewhere (for
example, the GOES flare catalog), and some is generated by the Solar
Dynamics Observatory Feature Finding Team \cite{???} to populate the
HEK.  The advantage of the HEK to SunPy is that it is a single service
that provides a homogeneous and well-described interface to a large
amount of feature/event information of interest to the solar physics
community.

SunPy accesses this information through the \texttt{hek} module, which
was developed through support from the European Space Agency Summer of
Code in Space (ESA-SOCIS) 2011.  The \texttt{hek} module makes use of
the HEK API
(http://vso.stanford.edu/hekwiki/ApplicationProgrammingInterface?action=print).
Every event type has required and optional properties; the current
list of events maintained by the HEK and their properties can be found
at http://www.lmsal.com/hek/VOEvent_Spec.html.

Simple HEK queries consist of start time, an end time, and an event
type (Example \ref{code:hek:simple}). Times can be specified in any
SunPy-acceptable format. Event types are specified as upper case, two
letter strings, and are identical to the two letter abbreviations
found at the HEK website, http://www.lmsal.com/hek/VOEvent_Spec.html.

\begin{listing}
\begin{minted}{python}
from sunpy.net import hek
client = hek.HEKClient()
tstart = '2011/08/09 07:23:56'
tend = '2011/08/09 12:40:29'
event_type = 'FL'
result = client.query(hek.attrs.Time(tstart,tend), hek.attrs.EventType(event_type))
\end{minted}
\caption{Simple HEK query, returning 19 entries.}
\label{code:hek:simple}
\end{listing}

The module \texttt{hek.attrs} contains attributes of the HEK that can be used to
construct HEK queries.  For example, a flare is an attribute of the
HEK, and so instead of specifying \texttt{hek.attrs.EventType('FL')}
in Example \ref{code:hek:simple}, this can also be expressed as
\texttt{hek.attrs.FL}. 

HEK attributes differ from VSO attributes (Section \ref{ssec:vso}) in
that many of them are wrappers that conveniently expose
comparisions by overloading Python operators.  This allows filtering
of the HEK entries by the properties of the event.  As was mentioned
above, the HEK stores feature/event metadata obtained in different
ways, known generally as {\it feature recognition methods}, or FRMs.
Example \ref{code:hek:frm} filters the results of the previous result
to return only those events that have the FRM 'SSW Latest Events'.
\begin{listing}
\begin{minted}{python}
result = client.query( hek.attrs.Time(tstart,tend), hek.attrs.EventType(event_type), hek.attrs.FRM.Name == 'SSW Latest Events')
\end{minted}
\caption{An HEK query that returns only those flares that were
  detected by the 'SSW Latest Events' feature recognition method.}
\label{code:hek:frm}
\end{listing}




For example you are able
to say AR & AR.NumSpots < 5 to find all active regions with less than
5 spots. 


As with the VSO query, you can use the fundamental logic
operators AND and OR to construct queries of almost arbitrary
complexity. Note that complex queries result in multiple requests to
the server which might make them less efficient.
